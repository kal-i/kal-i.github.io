        <p class="about-text">
          I recently graduated with a degree in Information Technology from STI College Legazpi,
          where I built my foundation in backend development and databases.
          I have experience developing desktop and mobile applications using technologies like Flutter
          (Dart), Java, C#, and SQL.
          <br><br>
          For my capstone project, I developed a desktop and mobile application using Flutter with a
          Dart backend (Dart Frog) and PostgreSQL, giving me a hands-on experience with authentication,
          API Design, creating Windows installers, and handling local deployment.
          <br><br>
          Outside of school, I explored different backend frameworks like Node and Express but eventually
          settled on Spring Boot. I came to love strongly typed languages and OOP, and I find it refreshing
          to work with something that provides compile-time feedback. While I don't hate JS, but debugging
          on it often felt unpredictable. Even with the help of TS, I realized I still prefer the structure and strict
          type safety of languages like Dart and Java.
          <br><br>
          I've also been studying Clean Architecture in Flutter because I like my code to be structured,
          modular, and maintainable; something that won't easily break when adding or changing features,
          since each module is mostly independent and can be isolated for testing and debugging.
          These practices paid off during my capstone, where I had to rewrite the core logic of our project after
          failing to meet the client's requirements, an experience that taught me the importance of building scalable
          and well-architected systems.
          <br><br>
          Fun fact: I naturally lean more toward backend development because I suck at frontends, spending twice
          (if not more) to make it look decent, with countless references and revisions.
